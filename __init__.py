"""
Mark the SD_Finance directory as a Python package.

This file is intentionally left blank. Its presence allows Python to
perform relative imports (e.g. ``from .config import SECRET_KEY``) when
running modules as part of a package. If you execute ``python app.py``
directly, the relative imports in ``app.py`` will fall back to
absolute imports defined in the file itself.
